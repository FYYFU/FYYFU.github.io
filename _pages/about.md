## About me

I'm a 1st-year PhD student in UCR where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Yue Dong](https://yuedong.netlify.app/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/) (advised by Prof. [Deyi Xiong](https://dyxiong.github.io/)), and my B.S. from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically conditional text generation, such as summarization and machine translation. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in conditional text generation, but problems like hallucination and security still exist. Besides these, I also have a strong interest in reinforcement learning (RL). Integrating advanced RL algorithms with NLP is a very interesting and challenging topic, and I look forward to combining them with conditional text generation through more effective and elegant methods.
